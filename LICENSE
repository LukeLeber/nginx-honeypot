(KILLGPL: Incompatible with Libraries Linked to the GPL)
============================================================================
 
"Free software" should be just that - free.  Extreme copy-left licenses 
such as the GPL, GPL2, GPL3, etc, and their users have twisted the 
term "free" to meet their own anti-business, anti-closed source agendas by 
forcing licensees to relicense their software under the same "viral" terms 
and by forcing licensees to distribute sources with binary distributions.  
This license stands in protest of such licenses in an attempt to protect 
the freedoms that extreme copy-left licenses have been taking away from 
software developers for far too long.
 
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the
"Software"), to deal in the Software with only one restriction: no part of
it may be included in software projects that are distributed under "viral" 
licensing schemes like those found in the GPL, GPL2, GPL3, etc.
 
There are no further usage restrictions.  Licensees are encouraged to use 
this software in both open and closed source applications, so long as no 
part of the combined work is licensed under extreme copy-left licenses.
 
The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included
in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.  Note - this notice 
does not have to appear in YOUR code, but must remain intact in the parts 
licensed under the KILLGPL.
